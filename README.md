### Problem Statement

The United Kingdom faces persistent challenges related to road safety, with road accidents resulting in casualties and significant economic and social costs. To address this issue and make informed decisions, there is a need for a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard that provides insights into accident data.

### Analysis

#### Dashboard Design and Visualization:

- **Power BI Dashboard:** Constructed a dynamic and interactive dashboard emphasizing data integration and visually appealing visualizations.
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Created a dashboard in Tableau with custom charts and insightful trend analyses.
- **Excel Dashboard:** Developed an interactive Excel dashboard incorporating pivot tables and visually compelling charts.
- **SQL:** Utilized SQL queries for data processing and analysis, including data aggregation, filtering, and joining to extract key metrics.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Identified and calculated primary KPIs, including Total Casualties and Total Accidents, for 2021 and 2022. YoY growth percentages were computed to assess trends and improvements.

#### Accident Severity Analysis:

- Analyzed accident severity by categorizing casualties into severity levels (Fatal, Serious, Minor) for both years. YoY growth percentages for each severity level were calculated.

#### Vehicle Type Analysis:

- Analyzed casualties based on vehicle types (Car, Truck, Motorcycle) for 2021 and 2022. YoY growth percentages were considered to identify trends.

#### Geospatial Analysis:

- Conducted geospatial analysis to determine casualties and accidents by road type, location, and time of day for the UK in 2021 and 2022.

#### Monthly Trends Comparison:

- Created a monthly trend analysis for a year-over-year comparison of casualties in 2021 and 2022.
